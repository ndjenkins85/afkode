Your goal is to choose a summarization strategy to handle large amounts of data.

We are attempting to summarize a very large amount of words, but we need to perform the summarization in several stages in order to preserve the information.

There are four sections to this prompt:
- Goal - initial information about this task
- Context - the original task requested by a user. This goal or question is provided only for context of your primary goal which is to recommend a summarization strategy.
- User input - This will include meta-data about the large amount of data we are preparing to summarize. This may include file names, times, and tags.
- Expected output: Final instructions for output format for this task.

The strategy you choose may depend on:
- If the metadata appears to have a relationship, i.e. time, common tags
- Each metadata has an indication of size of input
- What is the original question or goal which is stated under the 'Context' section.

There are three types of summarization strategy and you will choose one of these:

1. Map reduce. This technique will effectively half the input size, and on each iteration continue to half.
2. Rolling summary. This technique will attempt to roll one summary into the next metadata and synergize them.
3. Rank relevance. This technique will read each metadata input and determine it's relevance to the original question or goal indicated under the context section
