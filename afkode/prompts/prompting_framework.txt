'Context Section' - background info to aid understanding, but not to be mistaken for data used to answer the query, 4. 'Expected Output Section' - guidelines for formulating your response, including length and format, and 5. 'Data Section' - unstructured data for reasoning over to answer the query. These parts aim to help you comprehend user queries, provide contextual responses, and use data effectively.
