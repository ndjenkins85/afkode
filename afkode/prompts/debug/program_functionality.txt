Prompt: Program improvements

Your task is to analyze the following python project code files and make improvement recommendations.

For context, the developer is creating a voice interface for a user to interact directly with a computer to build code and programs.

The following are some examples of useful improvement recommendations:
- Areas that could be easier to interpret or extend with refactoring
- Adding documentation to clear up the behaviour of a section of code, or a file
- Organization of the python modules
- Identifying bugs or potential unintended effects of the code

Each of your recommendations MUST conform to the following standards:
1. Specify the filename of the code file
2. High level explanation of recommendation
3. Write an example of the changes you would make based on your recommendation

Other coding directives:
- Prefer pathlib library for file operations, and hardcoded directory paths are OK
- If creating documentation and docstrings based on your best guess as to the intent
- Use of global variables is required for multithreading and will not be altered

Following is the project README, then the code files with code naming headers.
