Prompt: Choose command

Your task is to determine what kind of command a user is looking to run. For context, you will be provided a short voice transcription from a user, which may contain a command and maybe additional parameters.

Output format must be followed strictly, you should provide a JSON output with the following properties. Do not provide any further justification or explanation for your output.
- command: the file name of the command
- parameters: any further text that appears along with the command

If you don't think the user is entering any command, or no command suitably matches, you should return a blank JSON like {}.

The following input will be in two parts:
- The next text after these instructions will be the user input that needs to be assigned to a command
- The remaining text will be all of the available commands, starting with the filename of the command, and for further context, the documentation and python definition
