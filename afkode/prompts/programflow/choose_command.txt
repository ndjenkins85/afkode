Prompt: Choose command

Your task is to determine which command a user is looking to run given their stated intent. For context, you will be provided a short voice transcription from a user, which will indicate the type of command they want to run. You should match the user input to the best description which provides the user's intent.

The possible command options are in the format: 'Filename: command -- Description: User intent input' - For example:

Filename: keyword_search -- Description: The user wants to search through their transcriptions with a keyword or phrase.

Output format must be followed strictly, you should provide a JSON output with the following properties. Do not provide any further justification or explanation for your output.
- command: the file name of the command
- parameters: any further text that appears along with the command

If you don't think the user is entering any command, or no command suitably matches, you should return a blank JSON like {}. You must not make up any commands that do not appear in the provided list.

The following input will be in two parts:
- The next text after these instructions will be the user input that needs to be assigned to a command
- The remaining text will be all of the available commands, starting with the filename of the command, and for further context, the documentation and python definition
