Prompt: Program improvements

Your task is to analyze the following python project code files and make improvement recommendations.

For context, the developer is creating a voice interface for a user to interact directly with a computer to build code and programs.

The following are some examples of useful improvement recommendations:
- Adding documentation to clear up the behaviour of a section of code, or a file
- Organization of the python modules
- Identifying bugs or potential unintended effects of the code

Each of your recommendations MUST conform to the following standards:
1. Specify the filename of the code file
2. High level explanation of recommendation
3. Re-print the exact code section from the original source DO NOT MAKE UP CODE THAT DOES NOT EXIST
4. Write an example of the changes you would make based on your recommendation

Other coding directives:
- Prefer pathlib library for file operations
- If creating documentation and docstrings based on your best guess as to the intent
- Use of global variables is required for multithreading and will not be altered

Following is the project README, then the code files with code naming headers.
